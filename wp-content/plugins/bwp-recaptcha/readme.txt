This plugin utilizes Google reCAPTCHA to help your blog stay clear of spams. You can use this plugin with Akismet and Contact Form 7.

== Description ==

In the 21th century, spamming could be one of the most annoying problems for a website. Especially if you use some publishing platforms like WordPress, your blog WILL be spammed and no default methods will save you from such nightmare. This plugin utilizes the popular anti-spam library, Google reCAPTCHA, to help your blog stay clear of spams.

Akismet and Contact Form 7 are supported out of the box.

    -   Show the captcha to all users (including admins) by default
    -   Contact Form 7:
        -   The shortcode `[bwp-recaptcha]` has been deprecated, use

            version 4.1 (last supported is 4.0.3). `bwprecaptcha` and
            `bwp_recaptcha` will still work with version 4.1+, so you won't

        keys in a multisite installation
